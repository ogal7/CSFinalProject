Final Project Proposal
Restaurant Rush!

	Our project is a simulation of owning a restaurant. The user is 
	a starting restaurant owner, who starts the game with $100,000 
	dollars.The user will pick staff members to work as waiters and 
	chefs and managers from a directory of workers with varying skills
	and required salaries. After they choose workers, they will be 
	allowed to pick the items on the menu and their prices. Certain 
	add-on options will  be available to choose from; for example, 
	adding illegal drugs to your food will increase the likelihood of 
	your restaurant being shut down, but will also increase customer 
	satisfaction and profit. There will also be options like karaoke, 
	live entertainment, and chocolate fountains. After the user creates
	their restaurant they can choose how many tables/the maximum capacity
	they would like to have. The purpose of the game is to create the 
	most successful restaurant. 
	
	After the initial creation, the user will visit their restaurant each 
	month. At each interval they will be told whether theyâ€™ve grown in the 
	last month, and what their biggest issue is.  If the restaurant has 
	been shut down by the FDA, the police, or by bankruptcy, the user has 
	lost the game. If, at that point, the user is still afloat and wishes
	to make changes, they may fire a worker and bring on a new one in hopes
	of more success. The game will end after 1 year. If, after 12 months 
	the restaurant is still running, the user has won. 
	
	Our game will incorporate a lot of math and probability, super/subclasses,
	multidimensional arrays, and user prompting.
